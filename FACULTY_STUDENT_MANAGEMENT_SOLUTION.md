# Faculty Student Management Solution

## Overview

This solution provides faculty members with comprehensive tools to manage and view all students enrolled in their courses. The implementation includes two main API endpoints that work together to give faculty complete visibility into their teaching responsibilities.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Faculty Courses
```
GET /api/v1/courses/faculty/{facultyId}
```
- Returns all courses assigned to a specific faculty member
- Includes course details, enrollment counts, and status information
- Useful for faculty to see their teaching load

### 2. Get Faculty Students
```
GET /api/v1/courses/faculty/{facultyId}/students
```
- Returns all students enrolled in courses taught by the faculty
- Includes comprehensive student information and academic data
- Provides advanced filtering, searching, and pagination capabilities

## Key Features

### üéØ **Comprehensive Student Information**
