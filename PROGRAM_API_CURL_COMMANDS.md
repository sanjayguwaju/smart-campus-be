## üöÄ Curl Commands

### Prerequisites
- **Base URL**: Replace `YOUR_BASE_URL` with your actual server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
- **Authentication**: Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid JWT access token
- **Admin Token**: Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid admin JWT token

### Authentication

First, you need to get an access token by logging in:

```bash
# Login to get access token
curl -X POST "YOUR_BASE_URL/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'
```

## üìã Program Model Schema

```javascript
{
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  department: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Department', required: true },
  level: { type: String, enum: ['Undergraduate', 'Postgraduate'], required: true },
  duration: { type: String, required: true },
  semesters: { type: Number, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, trim: true, maxlength: 1000 },
  prerequisites: [{ type: String, trim: true, maxlength: 100 }],
  image: { type: String, trim: true },

## üîê Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only endpoints are protected
3. **Input Validation**: All request data is validated
4. **Business Logic Validation**: Prevents duplicate programs, validates department existence
5. **Safe Deletion**: Prevents deletion of published programs

---

## üéØ Key Features

### Business Logic
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot create programs with same name in same department
- **Department Validation**: Ensures department exists before creating/updating programs
- **Safe Deletion**: Cannot delete published programs (must unpublish first)
- **Status Management**: Automatic status updates when publishing/unpublishing

### Advanced Features
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
- **Search**: Full-text search across name and description
- **Filtering**: Filter by department, level, status, published state
- **Sorting**: Sort by any field in ascending/descending order
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive program statistics for admins
- **Department Programs**: Get all programs for a specific department
- **Level Programs**: Get all programs for a specific level

---

## üìù Notes

- Replace `YOUR_BASE_URL` with your actual server URL
- Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid user token
- Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid admin token
- Replace `PROGRAM_ID` with actual program IDs from your database
- Replace `DEPARTMENT_ID` with actual department IDs from your database
- All endpoints require authentication
- Admin endpoints require admin privileges
- Published programs cannot be deleted (must unpublish first)
- Department must exist before creating/updating programs
- Program names are case-insensitive for duplicate checking within departments
